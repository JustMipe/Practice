## Practice project

**Description**  
This repository is used to practice rust and git.

## 🛠️ About project
It will contain functionalities and concepts I have learned and applied to the project so far
because practice and repetition is the mother of wisdom.
The original idea is to create a registration system and logging into it, 
but what will really come out of this I don't know myself yet.
